## About
</br>
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my projects during the 42 C Piscine!

This repository contains all of the projects that I completed during my time at the 42 C Piscine, a rigorous 4-week coding bootcamp. Each project is contained within its own directory, and includes all of the source code, Makefiles, and any necessary resources.

The projects cover a wide range of topics, including basic algorithms, data structures, system calls, networking, and more. Each project has its own set of requirements and constraints, and I worked diligently to ensure that my code met all of these requirements and was as efficient as possible.

I am proud of the work that I have done during the 42 C Piscine, and I believe that this repository serves as a testament to my dedication and hard work. I hope that others will find value in my code, whether it be as a reference for their own projects or as a source of inspiration for their own coding journey.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.
